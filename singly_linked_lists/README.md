## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the world of linked lists As Atlas T1 students, you're embarking on a journey to understand one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. Linked lists offer a flexible and efficient way to store and manipulate collections of data, providing a dynamic alternative to traditional arrays.

## Understanding Structs<a name="understanding-structs"></a>

Before diving into linked lists, it's crucial to grasp the concept of structs in C. Structs enable us to define custom data types, combining variables of different kinds under a single identifier. This feature is pivotal for constructing complex data structures like linked lists.

### Why Use Structs?

- **Customization**: Structs allow us to tailor data structures to fit specific needs, combining related pieces of information into a cohesive unit.
- **Efficiency**: By grouping related data, structs reduce redundancy and improve memory management.

## Challenges with Arrays<a name="challenges-with-arrays"></a>

Arrays, while straightforward and widely used, present several limitations that linked lists aim to address:

- **Fixed Size**: Arrays have a predetermined size, making it cumbersome to resize them dynamically.
- **Data Manipulation**: Inserting or deleting elements in an array can be inefficient, especially towards the end or in the middle, due to the need to shift subsequent elements.
- **Memory Utilization**: Arrays allocate memory contiguously, often leading to unused space if the array's size exceeds the number of elements stored.

## Introducing Linked Lists<a name="introducing-linked-lists"></a>

Linked lists are a linear collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not bound by a fixed size, allowing for dynamic growth and shrinkage.

## Declaring a Node Structure<a name="declaring-a-node-structure"></a>

To construct a linked list, we begin by defining a struct for our list nodes:

```c
typedef struct node {
    int data; // The data stored in this node
    struct node* next; // Pointer to the next node in the list
} node_t;
```

Here, `typedef` creates an alias `node_t` for the struct, streamlining references to the struct type. Each node comprises an integer `data` and a pointer `next`, linking to the subsequent node.

## Creating the Head of the List<a name="creating-the-head-of-the-list"></a>

The head of the list is represented by a pointer initialized to `NULL`, signifying an empty list:

```c
node_t* head = NULL;
```

## Inserting Nodes<a name="inserting-nodes"></a>

Ask students to implement a function that inserts a new node at the beginning of the list. This exercise will deepen their understanding of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and the unique properties of linked lists.

## Traversing the List: The Scavenger Hunt Concept<a name="traversing-the-list-the-scavenger-hunt-concept"></a>

Imagine traversing a linked list as going on a scavenger hunt, where each node holds a clue (data) leading to the next node. This metaphor helps visualize the sequential nature of linked lists and the importance of following links to navigate through the list.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

As you delve deeper into data structures, remember that linked lists are just the beginning. They serve as a foundation for more advanced data structures, offering a glimpse into the vast landscape of algorithms and data manipulation techniques. Thank you for engaging with this material, and happy coding!
